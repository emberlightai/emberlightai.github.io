          <p className="mb-6">
            Welcome to Emberlight! We've drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the "Terms") so you'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you as a user of our Services. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where they may still read like a traditional contract. There's a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Emberlight ("Emberlight"). So please read them carefully. By using Emberlight, or any of our other products or services that are subject to these Terms (which we refer to collectively as the "Services"), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don't agree with them, then don't use the Services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            These Terms apply if you live in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the United States. If you live outside of the United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the United States, we provide you the Services and your relationship is governed by the Emberlight Terms of Service (Non-US Users).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 font-bold uppercase">
            ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND EMBERLIGHT AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND EMBERLIGHT WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS EXPLAINED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE.

Emberlight grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the Services.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Many of our Services let you create, upload, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Emberlight and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content. This license is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The content you submit are set to be viewable by Everyone to public Services, like Public Profiles, or Lens Studio, "Public Content." Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Emberlight, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners all of the same rights you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content (including the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained therein) in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed. When you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Public Content, you also grant Emberlight, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to use the name, likeness, and voice, of anyone featured in your Public Content for commercial and non-commercial purposes. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, likeness, or voice are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site. All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

            <p className="mb-4">
              While we're not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, send, or store through the Service.

            <p className="mb-4">
              We, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalized advertising based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.

              We always love to hear from our users.

              Emberlight respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that violates or infringes someone else's rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right. When you submit content to the Service, you agree and represent that you own that content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances, and authorizations in order to submit it to the Service (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in any sound recordings, synchronize any compositions to any content, publicly perform any compositions or sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any music not provided by Emberlight that you include in your content) and grant the rights and licenses contained in these Terms for your content.

              Emberlight honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of.

If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please file a notice to copyright emberlightai@gmail.com. Don't use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. If you file a notice to us for copyright infringement, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). That means the notice must:

              To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it's important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don't use for any other account. If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Support. Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings. You agree not to create any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.

              We're relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time for any reason, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.

              While we hope you remain a lifelong Emberlight user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Emberlight account (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of the Services you are using).

              We may terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, our Community Guidelines, or the law, for any reason outside of our control, or for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may terminate these Terms, stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. And while we'll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can't guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND EMBERLIGHT AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> In this Section 17 (the "Arbitration Agreement"), You and Emberlight agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Emberlight are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase "all claims and disputes" also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>b. Arbitration Rules.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum's rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>d. Authority of the Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Emberlight. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Emberlight.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>e. Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> YOU AND EMBERLIGHT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Emberlight are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Emberlight over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND EMBERLIGHT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>f. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead, all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 17.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>g. Right to Waive.</strong> Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>h. Opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Emberlight can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Emberlight in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Emberlight username and the email address you used to set up your Emberlight account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must email the opt-out notice to emberlightai@gmail.com.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>i. Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Emberlight may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>j. Arbitration Agreement Survival.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Emberlight.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              To the extent that these Terms allow you or Emberlight to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Emberlight agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Emberlight consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

              These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 4, make up the entire agreement between you and Emberlight, and supersede any prior agreements.

We reserve the right to transfer our rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another entity, provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
